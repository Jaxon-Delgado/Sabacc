            <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory

            <p>Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the
                stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy….</p>
